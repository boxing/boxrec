⚠️ This project is an unofficial way to get data from BoxRec.  Things will break as time goes on because we cannot control the BoxRec website and changes they make.  It is free to use and therefore do not expect things to always work and don't expect things to necessarily be fixed hastily.  If you want things fixed, please consider [helping to fix them](https://github.com/boxing/boxrec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-walkthrough) and creating a PR.  If you need any more information on how things work, please feel free to get in touch.

If you are just pointing out that something is broken, that is fine and appreciated.  

Please understand that the project is non-sponsored, free to use and [personally](https://github.com/mikedidomizio), I have other projects I would like to work on.

Thank you for understanding⚠️
