⚠️ Hi, if you're starting to use this package and having issues, proxies/VPNs may affect connectivity.  Some cloud providers and services are blocked (AWS/GCP) from accessing BoxRec.  
A proper error with this package should not include TLS, IP addresses or anything of that sort.  This package is set to handle working login failures gracefully and return you the error.

If the issue persists, please fill out any additional information below. ⚠️
