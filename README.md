This project allows you to query information from [BoxRec](http://boxrec.com) and return it in JSON format.
The purpose of this project is to act as an API for BoxRec.

## Installation

This project is written in [Node](http://nodejs.org).  Currently this project supports Node 8-10.

```javascript
npm install boxrec --save
```
or 
```
yarn add boxrec
```

## Quick Start
```javascript
const boxrec = require("boxrec").default;
```
or 
```javascript
import boxrec from "boxrec";
```

use credentials to log into BoxRec and then use any of the [methods](https://github.com/boxing/boxrec#methods-how-to-use) below

## Security Requirements

### Non HTTPs requests

 BoxRec does not support HTTPS.  Communication between the Node server and BoxRec is [insecure](http://www.stealmylogin.com/).  
This is not a flaw in the package design but a design flaw in BoxRec.


## Questions

<a name="globalId">**What and where is the BoxRec global ID?**</a>

The BoxRec global ID or ID is the unique ID of the person, event, bout, etc.  It can be found in the URL bar.  For people it can also be found on their page.

examples:
  
(Person) Vasiliy Lomachenko - http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/659771.  The BoxRec global ID is `659771`.

(Bout) Terence Crawford vs. Amir Khan - http://boxrec.com/en/event/778793/2299385.  The BoxRec bout ID is `778793/2299385`

(Event) Golden Boy May 4th 2019 Event - http://boxrec.com/en/event/781894.  The BoxRec event ID is `781894`

<a name="globalIdInconsistencies">**Why is there global ID and ID?**</a>

I took the safe approach and assumed that there may be some difference between the two.  There doesn't seem to be but better
safe than sorry.

<a name="isUsingThisSoftwareLegal">**Is using this software legal?**</a>

When this software was initially written, the [Terms and Conditions](http://boxrec.com/en/terms_conditions) on BoxRec did not include anything about [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping).

BoxRec had updated their [Terms and Conditions](http://boxrec.com/en/terms_conditions) sometime in the middle of 2018 to include that you may not use software to extract data from BoxRec.

[Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) on wikipedia states under legal issues _"The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of use of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear"._

Conclusion: It is unclear.  What you do with this package though could very well be illegal.
