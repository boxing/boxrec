# Contributing

## Welcome

If there is an [open issue](https://github.com/boxing/boxrec/issues) feel free to comment that you'll work on it.  This prevents multiple people from working on the same issue.

## Issues and Bugs
If you have found a problem, follow these steps:

- Create an issue [here](https://github.com/boxing/boxrec/issues)
- Give a good example on how to reproduce this issue.  Ex. When I search for `Mike Tyson` using these parameters `{ first_name: "Mike", last_name: "Tyson" }`, it says he has X wins but he actually has Y wins.
- Label it accordingly: "bug" if it's an issue with this code.  
- [Sometimes the UI for BoxRec changes and breaks the code as well, there is a specific label for that](https://github.com/boxing/boxrec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22BoxRec+UI+changed%22).  This allows tracking of changes to the BoxRec UI.

## Suggestions
If you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue with the label "suggestion".  Please note that this project is more of a BoxRec API and nothing more.
